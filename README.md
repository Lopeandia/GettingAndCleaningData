This code clean the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone in five steps. You can se a full description of the raw data [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

STEP 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

STEP 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

STEP 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

STEP 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

STEP 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
